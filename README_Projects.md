# ML PROJECTS

## Description

This repository contains the Machine Learning projects which were done during my B-Tech degree. Datasets were obtained from Kaggle. From this projects, I have gained basic knowledge about ML functions and their applications in Real-life scenario.

## Project : 1 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

- This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
- The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.17% of all transactions.
- Used sampling technique to overcome this problem.
**CLASSIFICATION MODELS USED**
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest Classifier
- XG Boost

## Project : 2 - MOVIES RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

- This dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017 which was taken from the TMDB 5000 movie Dataset.
- Used various text-preprocessing technique and **Content-based filtering** method to recommend the movies.
- Built an interactive web app using **Streamlit** function.
- Deployed the poster of the recommended movies which were fetched from **TMDB database** through **API key**.
